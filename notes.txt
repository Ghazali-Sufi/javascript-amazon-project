Git: Track changes in our code
Repository: a folder where changes are being tracked

Data attribute: is an html attribute, allows us to attach any information to an element

External Libraries: code outside of our project

Model: saves and manages the Data, so all the code in data folder is called the model, because that codes saves and manages our data 

View: The code that takes the data and displays it on the page, it's a code that takes our data form the data folder/database and then generates all the html

Controller: runs some code when we interact some page, like event listeners, because they do something when we interact the page or with the view

First we use the model to generate the view, then when we interact with the view it will run the controller, then the controller will update the model 

MVC is a way to organize and design our code

Automated Testing: is using code to test code

Taste suite(suwiit): a group of related tests
